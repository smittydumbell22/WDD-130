    <h2>Cassie Smith</h2>
    <p>*Hello Everyone,

        My name is Cassie Smith. I live in the US State of Arizona.
        My husband and I will be celebrating 19 years of marriage at the end of the year. 
        We have four kids  17, 15, 13 and 5 years old. We have a Senior in high school
        and a kindergartner. I am currently working on a bachelorâ€™s in applied technology.
        I have been a stay-at-home mom for 18 years, but now that my youngest has started
        school, I hope to finish up my degree and get plugged into a software engineer career. <br>
    
        *A few of my favorite things include traveling, weightlifting, and hiking. 
        The traveling destination that is at the top of my bucket list is Machu Picchu, Peru.
        My husband and I hope to visit there for our 20th anniversary. <br>

    
        *I look forward to meeting everyone and wish you all a great semester!
    </p>
